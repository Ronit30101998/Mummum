                    Mummum… there's something I've been carrying inside my heart for a long time.
                    It's not dramatic, not forced… just honest.
                    <span class="highlight">Every time I talk to you, something in me softens</span>

                    So before you see everything I've written, I want you to know this…
                    <span class="highlight">none of it is to pressure you</span>.
                    It's just… my way of showing how deeply you still matter to me.
